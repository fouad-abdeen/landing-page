# RoundTrip's Landing Page

"RoundTrip's Landing Page" is a simple social media reference landing page (as an alternative to "Linktree") for the first cycling news outlet in Lebanon.

I built the web page with React, Bootstrap, and React Bootstrap using the best possible coding practices.
 
All the data fetched from static JSON files hosted on Github.
